Possible interest in CHEOPS proposal from Lauren.",Looks like a transit signal but there is a possible single secondary at 1506 need to check multi-sector data.,"RadVel config file for 2-planet circular fit + GP, Periodograms prefer 24-day period.  Second planet?, Various forms of periodogram prefer ~24 days over the 18-day transit period.  A 2-planet model puts the 18- and 24-day signals near 4:3 resonance.  Mass of 18d planet is 11 M_e in a 2-planet model, 15 M_e in a 1-planet model.  Bayes-factor periodogram of HIRES+APF velocities attached., Update 2019-12-11: 23d signal still dominates, but 18d signal starting to emerge in residuals.  Would be useful if we could pull the S_HK values from APF spectra to diagnose origin of 23d signal., RadVel output for a 2-planet, circular fit with the first planet now at 9 days. Holding slope and curvature fixed, but possible trend in the residuals., July TKS meeting assessment: observe high priority., 9d period is visible in the RVs, confirming it is not 18d. Single transit is thought to be a 21d transiting planet, which also shows up in the RVs.  Nicholas is writing this one up., RadVel config file for the fit above, Nicholas Scarsdale noticed yesterday that if the period of TOI-509.01 was actually at half the period in the SPOC report (at 9 days instead of 18) then a transit would fall in the gap in the light curve. I've attached the light curve with the 9-day transits marked. The RV signal at 9 days with a circular orbit is now little more than 3-sigma, compared to a non-detection at 18 days., This is the output of a 2-planet circular fit + GP that I made back around the start of April. Working on editing my local config file to be Jump-compatible so I can upload it as well., This is TOI-509.

It looks like we now have a 3.4 sigma mass detection. There is clearly something else going on in the residuals which looks to be present in both the HIRES and Grand APF velocities., Radius Planet = 2.8 R⊕
Period = 7.0 days, In the Oct. 29 TKS meeting we theorized that the poor APF RV performance is due to the high Vsini and the relatively small chunk size in the APF Doppler analysis (because of smaller CCD pixels in APF compared to HIRES).  Howard is going to try running the Dop Code with larger chunks to see if performance improves., This target is T000554, APF velocities are performing really poorly. I'm not sure why. They are just as bad when using the Keck template so I don't think the template is the problem., I dusted off the old iGrand doppler code and ran the APF data through it. This code fits full orders at a time so high vsini is less problematic. I made a custom RadVel fit that uses these iGrand APF velocities., July 2019 meeting assessment: Get HIRES template + jitter assessment, Public comment notes the period might be 2x (14 days instead of 7). Looking at the 3 transits in the Sector 5 light curve, the second event occurs near a momentum dump and seems noisier than the first and third events (though SPOC only suggests an odd-even transit difference of 0.24 sigma). Something else to note is that the SPOC report is using a pre-Gaia DR2 value for the stellar radius (1.8 R_sun, whereas TICv8 now has 1.4 R_sun). Maybe the RVs will do a better job of phasing up if we try a 14-day fit?, This is a potentially interesting (but challenging) RM target. It’s a ~3 Rearth planet in a 7 day orbit.  The star has high Vsini (11 km/s), but the transit depth is only 350 ppm, giving an expected Doppler amplitude of 4 m/s.  This should be observable for a V = 6.9 target and a transit duration of 3.3 hours.  There don’t appear to be any well-timed transits for HIRES in the coming year.  Maybe if we can get the APF RVs working for this high Vsini star, that’s an option.   We could also think about other facilities.",4.0

Title: The TESS Keck Survey I: Masses, Densities, and Orbits of Three Sub-Neptune Sized Transiting Planets in TOI-561
Authors: Lauren M. Weiss, Fei Dai, the TESS Keck Survey, and others

Abstract: Systems with multiple transiting planets provide excellent natural laboratories for testing the physics of planet formation, since the planets all formed around the same star and from the same protoplanetary disk.  Furthermore, the formation of ultra-short period planets (USPs), which are primarily rocky planets with orbital periods $<1 $ day, is poorly understood.  The NASA \TESS\ Mission has discovered TOI-561, a multi-planet system containing a USP.  This bright ($V=10.2$) star hosts three small transiting planet candidates: TOI-561 b (P=0.4 days, \rpl=1.6\,\rearth), c (P=10.8 days, \rpl= 3.2\,\rearth), and d (P=16.4 days, \rpl=2.8\,\rearth).  With radial velocities obtained on Keck/HIRES and [other facilities welcome], we confirm the planetary nature of all three candidates.  Planet b has \mpl= and \rhopl = , which are consistent with a rocky composition.  Planet c has \mpl= and \rhopl=, and planet d has \mpl= and \rhopl=), both of which are consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope.  The masses, radii, and orbits of the TOI-561 planets can be used to constrain the history of the system, and in particular to elucidate how the USP arrived at its present orbit.

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825). To confirm this, it'd be great to measure alpha-element abundances from the HIRES spectra. I can look into this, but it'd probably quicker and more reliable to ask John Brewer to run SME. If the star is indeed alpha-enhanced this would remove the discrepancy since it would enhance the bulk metallicity [M/H] (used by the interior models); it would be also be a nice spin on this system since there aren't many known multis around old, thick disc stars.

Title: The TESS Keck Survey I: Masses, Densities, and Orbits of Three Sub-Neptune Sized Transiting Planets in TOI-561
Authors: Lauren M. Weiss, Fei Dai, the TESS Keck Survey, and others

Abstract: Systems with multiple transiting planets provide excellent natural laboratories for testing the physics of planet formation, since the planets all formed around the same star and from the same protoplanetary disk.  Furthermore, the formation of ultra-short period planets (USPs), which are primarily rocky planets with orbital periods $<1 $ day, is poorly understood.  The NASA \TESS\ Mission has discovered TOI-561, a multi-planet system containing a USP.  This bright ($V=10.2$) star hosts three small transiting planet candidates: TOI-561 b (P=0.4 days, \rpl=1.6\,\rearth), c (P=10.8 days, \rpl= 3.2\,\rearth), and d (P=16.4 days, \rpl=2.8\,\rearth).  With radial velocities obtained on Keck/HIRES and [other facilities welcome], we confirm the planetary nature of all three candidates.  Planet b has \mpl= and \rhopl = , which are consistent with a rocky composition.  Planet c has \mpl= and \rhopl=, and planet d has \mpl= and \rhopl=), both of which are consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope.  The masses, radii, and orbits of the TOI-561 planets can be used to constrain the history of the system, and in particular to elucidate how the USP arrived at its present orbit.

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825). To confirm this, it'd be great to measure alpha-element abundances from the HIRES spectra. I can look into this, but it'd probably quicker and more reliable to ask John Brewer to run SME. If the star is indeed alpha-enhanced this would remove the discrepancy since it would enhance the bulk metallicity [M/H] (used by the interior models); it would be also be a nice spin on this system since there aren't many known multis around old, thick disc stars.

Title: The TESS Keck Survey I: Masses, Densities, and Orbits of Three Sub-Neptune Sized Transiting Planets in TOI-561
Authors: Lauren M. Weiss, Fei Dai, the TESS Keck Survey, and others

Abstract: Systems with multiple transiting planets provide excellent natural laboratories for testing the physics of planet formation, since the planets all formed around the same star and from the same protoplanetary disk.  Furthermore, the formation of ultra-short period planets (USPs), which are primarily rocky planets with orbital periods $<1 $ day, is poorly understood.  The NASA \TESS\ Mission has discovered TOI-561, a multi-planet system containing a USP.  This bright ($V=10.2$) star hosts three small transiting planet candidates: TOI-561 b (P=0.4 days, \rpl=1.6\,\rearth), c (P=10.8 days, \rpl= 3.2\,\rearth), and d (P=16.4 days, \rpl=2.8\,\rearth).  With radial velocities obtained on Keck/HIRES and [other facilities welcome], we confirm the planetary nature of all three candidates.  Planet b has \mpl= and \rhopl = , which are consistent with a rocky composition.  Planet c has \mpl= and \rhopl=, and planet d has \mpl= and \rhopl=), both of which are consistent with an interior rocky core overlaid with a low-mass volatile envelope.  The masses, radii, and orbits of the TOI-561 planets can be used to constrain the history of the system, and in particular to elucidate how the USP arrived at its present orbit.

Dear Lauren,

I have cc-ed here the major HARPS-N people involved with TOI-561 (Giampaolo and Luca) and our HARPS-N President (Stéphane).

We (well, Luca) ran some analyses on our current data and just discussed all of it in our team meeting.

We now have 26 RVs spanning ~ 2months with an average precision of ~1m/s.

We fail to find significant results on masses for all three of the planets. This was a tad surprising to us given that you found 2/3 sigma detections with the same amount of data.

Since this is an intriguing target for multiple science reasons, we would like to require more data in our upcoming runs before deciding what to do and how to proceed. Our next run is the first week of February.

Are you still observing this and would you mind sharing your plans?

I am not sure whether either set is incorporating uncertainties in the stellar radius., Email from Dan Huber to LMW 2020 Jan 03:

Hi Lauren,

My preliminary modeling shows that our best estimates for Teff and L (from Gaia) are hard to reconcile with the measured [Fe/H] from Specmatch. I then noticed that TOI-561 has high Gaia proper motion:

PM_RA: -108.432 0.088
PM_DE: -61.511 0.094

Combining this with the Gaia RV makes the star kinematically consistent with the thick disc (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07825). To confirm this, it'd be great to measure alpha-element abundances from the HIRES spectra. I can look into this, but it'd probably quicker and more reliable to ask John Brewer to run SME. If the star is indeed alpha-enhanced this would remove the discrepancy since it would enhance the bulk metallicity [M/H] (used by the interior models); it would be also be a nice spin on this system since there aren't many known multis around old, thick disc stars.

Hi Lauren,

I checked in on the job and it is already done, however, I don't have time today or tomorrow to look at it.  I can give you some rough numbers and a sense of how things came out and I will give you plots & real numbers at the end of the week.  I haven't applied my empirical corrections to the values quoted below, so they will change a wee bit, but are close.

Teff ~ 5300 K ± 25
logg ~ 4.47 ± 0.05
[Fe/H] ~ -0.45, alphas closer to -0.25, so it is alpha enhanced.  Oxygen is coming back anomalously high though (+0.1) so I want to take a look at the fit etc. first.

Hope you're doing well. We noticed that there are 33 APF observations of TOI 1135 reported on the SG2/SG4 sheet. Are these your data (or your collaborators)?

You've probably noticed that it's a relatively young star. Based on Li EW and rotation, it appears to be roughly around Praesepe/Hyades age. We're interested in the system as well, but given that you're pretty far along toward a mass measurement (hope that's panning out!), we were considering Doppler tomography observations to measure the obliquity rather than going after an orbit. If you have already scheduled or obtained spectroscopy during transit yourself, that could influence our plans to do the same. In the interest of not wasting/duplicating effort, would you be willing to share your plans for this system?",5.0

TOI-1169 is attributed to a fake star i.e. the blended combination (TIC 302518439, Tmag=10.4) of two real stars (TIC 802647157, Tmag=10.6 and TIC 802647158, Tmag=11.3). From Sam's calculations, this means the actual transit depth is more like ~1.3% if it's on TIC 802647157 and ~2.3% if on TIC 802647158 (compared to ~1% on the fake, blended star). See the screenshot below for the TIC8 entries. TIC 302518439, the fake star, is the result of imperfect automated matching between different source catalogs: unresolved stars of near equal brightness may be listed in e.g. 2MASS as a single source, but are resolved by DR2 as two sources, meaning the automated cross-matching produces three ""stars"" in the end. All this being said, the event is still v-shaped and Sam has turned off TOI-1169 on the SG2/4 spreadsheets, but we should keep this scenario in mind when evaluating the DV reports for TOIs with close companions., Observed for Peter Plavchan.  Likely unresolved binary and false positive.",

The tl;dr version is that this target is likely a false positive.
---------------------------------------
TTF Note: [Andrew Howard interested in preliminary check before DT run.] Detect the event on target with extreme precision (<0.5ppt/5min) or clear the field of NEBs, especially the neighbors 9"" N and 16"" NW. In other words, you will likely need to observe focused to clear the field. Full transits are preferred, but partials with more than 50% in-transit may also be useful.
Justin Wittrock observed a full on 20191103 in R and detected a possible ~250 ppt NEB in the T3/T4 neighboring pair 16"" NW of target. This is about the right depth to cause the TESS detection. Note that the apparent early egress in the target star light curve was likely caused by a shift in pointing at that time, and is unlikely to be astrophysical.
Investigating the TESS FFIs using an r=0.5 pixel aperture appears to rule out the 770 ppm event on target and suggests a ~2000 ppm undeblended depth in the T3/T4 neighboring pair 16"" NW of target (see in-line finder field and light curve below).
Andrew H., this candidate is looking like it will get confirmed as an NEB. We normally use the disposition possible NEB (PNEB) after the first detection of an apparent NEB, and then move to NEB after a second detection confirms it wasn't just a chance alignment with the TESS ephemeris. If we can show from further analysis of the TESS data that the NEB is off target, sometimes we will move the disposition directly to NEB after a single observation. I think the T3 light curve from FFIs shown below suggests that the event is in the neighboring star, but out of an abundance of caution, I'll leave it active to try to get a confirmation of the NEB at a second epoch, unless you feel these data are enough to convince you to abandon your DT run.
PC => PNEB
The next observation should be a full transit in a red (r', R, i', I, z) filter to confirm the return of the PNEB on the neighbor 16"" NW.
Karen, This object is a potentially interesting obliquity target with Vsini = 12 and a predicted RM amplitude of 8 m/s.  The star is V = 9.7 and the planet is approximately Neptune size with P = 2 days.  It looks like it’s in the sub-Neptune desert or at least a region of low occurrence with an insolation flux of ~2000 time the Earth value.  There’s a transit opportunity during Christmas night 2019 when we’re on the telescope., An email from Karen Collins:
--------------------------------------
Khalid Barkaoui and the TRAPPIST-North team observed a full on 20191124 and reconfirmed the ~on-time arrival of the NEB 16"" NW of the target. This combined the consistent generally direction of the QLP offsets and the FFI analysis give a strong conclusion of NEB.
PNEB => NEB (and retired)

Clean SB2 and Gaia/HIRES RVs agree., 8 HIRES shots in hand -- time for a template (or synthetic template analysis)?, Correlated residuals in recent runs -- worth investigating S_HK & H-alpha activity indices for signs of any correlation w/RVs., From Peter Plavchen:
""
We've been following TOI 1411 with iSHELL.  I see your group has 2 epochs.

I wanted to see what the current status of your team's observations are, to compare notes, since we have so few targets on our list.

We've got 10 epochs.  We're not detecting anything yet.  We can tell however the RV signal is not dominated by the transiting planet time-scale, and find a marginal candidate signal at 9.27 days.

The star shows clear photometric variability of around 10 days, so I'm guessing this 9.27d signal is stellar activity even at K-band.

If the companion has dV = 5,  SNR_contamination = 100.  The target could be observed with counts=60k (SNR_Poisson = 100), and the total SNR would be ~100/sqrt(2)., Here's a an assessment of two potential issues with this target. (1) is the target dV < 5? and (2) can we be sure the transit is occurring around the brighter component. 

# 1. What's the contrast? 

a) the primary star is ~K1 with M_V = 5.9, M_I = 5.0, M_K = 4.0, R ~ 0.85 Rsun.
b) assuming the companion is bound and main-sequence at delta-K of 3.7, the secondary is an M4V with M_V = 12.8, M_I = 10.0, M_K 7.7, R ~ 0.24 Rsun
c) so delta V ~ 6.9

# 2. Is the transit around the primary? 

a) Depth diluted depth is is d = 800e-6
b) Assuming transit is around the primary, Rp = sqrt(d) * R_star = 2.6 Re a garden-variety sub-Neptune
c) Assuming transit is around the secondary, the true depth larger by a factor of 100x because delta-I ~ 5mag. So Rp = sqrt(100 * d) * R_star = 7.3 Re. 
d) While we cannot rule out that it's a planet around the secondary directly, 7.3 Re objects are very rare around M4V stars. Also, a model comparison of the light curve fits with different levels of dilution could be more definitive.

With P = 47 days, Rp = 2.4 Re, and F = 6 Fe, this system is one of the coolest sub-Neptunes available.  Two major concerns need to be addressed first: 1) which star is transiting?  2) what is the primary/secondary contrast in V-band?  If the contrast is >5 mag, then the RVs will probably be unaffected, based on experience.  Until we can satisfactorily address those concerns, let's put the star on hold., The second source is worrisome.  Let's try hard to preserve this target though, if possible.

Given that that Hara's team had 290 SOPHIE RVs in their paper, and are planning to get more, it seems unlikely that our RVs are going to add substantially more information to the system.  On the other hand, maybe Ashley would like to do an asteroseismic analysis in a contribution to the second SOPHIE team paper or as a standalone paper. 
If there's interest, let's pursue a paper.  If not, let's contribute our RVs to the SOPHIE team., Recent TOI release has revealed a new transiting inner planet. One of the special aspects of this system is the chain of 3:2 mean motion resonances. The orbital period of the new (1.3 Earth radius) inner planet is 2.18 days, which further adds to the chain since it's in 3:2 resonance with the inner 3.4 day period RV planet. So the chain is even longer than expected! This is part of our APT program monitoring TESS known exoplanet hosts and so I have request with Dave Latham that we lead the discovery paper, for which we can also include the HIRES data. I sent Dave the request on Dec 5th and still awaiting response., Andrew Howard emailed Hara for the SOPHIE data, and I put it onto Cadence and spooled up a RadVel file. Results now available., https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.13296
New paper by Hara et. al ""The SOPHIE search for northern extrasolar planets. XVII. A compact planetary system in a near 3:2 mean motion resonance chain"" 
They are claiming 4 planets and a possible fifth., Though I looked, I could not find that the Hara paper includes the SOPHIE velocities used in their analysis of this system., Hara paper indicates candidate RV signals at 18 and 35 days. This could be planets, or the rotation period., Web TESS viewing tool suggests 6 total sectors of data, doubling the asteroseismic detection probability (>0.5). This is now a high priority target for Ashley's Thesis, This is an ATL (asteroseismic target list) target with a fairly decent detection probability and because it has already known planets, would make the asteroseismic detection more valuable. I've had a look at the single sector and see some power excess where we expect (~2000 muHz), but it's too soon to tell. If there is any interest within the group on this system, let's chat. I think we expect a few more sectors for this target so we may be able to get some asteroseismic constraints!, I received the message below from Nathan Hara:

Dear Andrew, 

Things are pretty good in Switzerland, thanks for your concern. I hope you’re doing well too. 

You are right about the data, there seems to have been a misunderstanding between A&A and us, so that the the data is not online yet.I have attached the data points analysed in our paper. 

Also, I’ll let you know that the SOPHIE consortium is also planning to do a follow-up analysis with more TESS data. We have been contacted by Jennifer Burt, Chelsea Huang (MIT) and Sam Quinn from CfA, who are interested in participating to the analysis. SOPHIE observations have resumed a couple of weeks ago, so that we should have a few dozen more points by the end of July. We’re also in discussion with the HARPS-N team to add about 30 measurements. Maybe we could coordinate our papers, to avoid unnecessary duplications. Let me know what you think!

Best,
Nathan",1.0

We present the discovery and characterization of a transiting sub-Neptune-sized planet around TOI-1611 (also known as HD207897 or TIC 264678534), based on photometry and radial velocity measurements obtained by the short cadence of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and SOPHIE high precision spectrograph. The host star is a bright (V=8.37) K0 dwarf which was continuously observed by TESS during sectors 18 and 19 while it was initially monitored in the context of the SOPHIE exoplanet consortium’s dedicate to explore of low-mass planets which obtained 44 high-resolution spectra over 3 years. By using the transit least squares (TLS) algorithm and considering the stellar host characteristics, we find that TOI-1611b is a mini- Neptune planet with radii of 2.2 R_Earth and orbits around its host star at a period of 16.2 days. We analyze the RV SOPHIE measurements, establish the planetary nature of this TESS candidate, and measure a planetary mass of 19.7 M_Earth. A simultaneous joint model of photometry and RVs data using two different packages, PASTIS and EXOFAST V2 in order to increase the precision of the planetary parameter is done., Summarizing some Slack discussion:
Howard notes: ""CFOP working group SG2/4 just posted a note about TOI-1611 (CPS name= 207897). A Masters student from IAC in Spain, lead by Enric Palle will be writing it up using archival SOPHIE data. I think we should consider offering our HIRES data to their paper. We have seven HIRES RVs taken in 2004-2015. This may not be helpful for mass determination, but it may help constrain long term companions.  This target to  far North(dec=~84), making it challenging to observe at Keck.""
Andrew noted that it looks like a great target if the planet is real.  We should collect a few more RVs and contribute to Palle et al.  If the planet pans out, let's include it in TKS.
Teo noted that it was rejected from TKS because of 5-sigma odd-even variation in QLP, but will be reconsidered in SPOC. 
Ian noted that the SOPHIE team (apparently) sees the Doppler signal, giving confidence in the planet interpretation., Abstract of Heidari et al. (in prep.) posted to the MIT Spacebook:

55 Cancri hosts five known planets (Fischer et al. 2009) with at least one that transits (Winn et al. 2011). The orbital periods are P = 0.74,14.6, 44, 260, and 5200 days. The middle three planets (b, c, and f) are approximately Saturn-mass while the innermost, transiting planet (e) is a super-Earth and the outermost planet (d) is a super-Jupiter., The orbital period of the inner super-Earth was initially misreported.  Dawson & Fabrycky (2010) identified it as an ultra-short period planet and (correctly) attributed the error to a daily alias.  https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...722..937D/abstract, Here's a really nice review of the 55 Cnc system (also named Copernicus?!), including the many misinterpretations of this system before our present understanding, by Debra Fischer: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11925.pdf, This is part of Lauren's RV-multis-bright program.
There is an emerging planet candidate at 7700 days, K = 20 m/s.  This is not activity as initially reported in Baluev (2015), because the S-values clearly have a period of only 10 years.  Also, activity signals do not have amplitudes of 20 m/s.  This is also not the companion star (55 Cnc B), which is 85"" away, which, at a parallax of 80 mas aka 12.5 pc, has separation 85"" = 1000 AU, which has P >>> 20 years.  At 20 m/s and P=20 years, this has msini of ~a couple Jupiters., Winn et al. (2012) identified transits of the inner planet e - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...737L..18W/abstract",3.0

Getting a mass for the USP (P=0.55d, Rp=1.55Re) is possible, but will require a concerted high-cadence campaign, perhaps with multiple observations per night.  With V = 9.7, I think it would be worth it, but it will require planning.  The detection of planets with longer periods will be limited by activity that will likely have an amplitude in the ~15-20 m/s regime., Apparent linear trend of 5 m/s/day --> binary?, Stellar position on HR diagram is consistent w/ binary sequence, Plan: get at least 1 more RV on APF to leverage the April epoch, test the linear trend hypothesis, get msini/a^2 limit on long-period companion (if applicable), There is one piece of the puzzle that does not fit. The Gaia RV and the Telluric RV agree. This means that the linear trend should be less than say a few hundred m/s, as those are the errors on both RVs, or else Gaia observed this system at the same phase of some binary orbit, which is inherently very unlikely.   

Also, I double checked the coordinates. Since this is a HIP star, the coords used for BC are coming out of the Hipparcos structure (rather than a Gaia or Simbad query)., Spectroscopic vetting looks OK, but unclear if the discrepancy between Gaia RV and SM RV is significant.",5.0

(2011) found transits of HD 97658 b using ground-based photometry from the Automated Photometric Telescope (APT)!!  Five partial transits were observed and all showed egress at 2-3.5 sigma significance.  Four other epoch were observed under similar conditions, when transits were not predicted, and transits were not detected!   Combining the five nights with predicted transits gave a 5.5-sigma detection with a transit depth of 1470 ± 260 ppm.  The four nights without transits were consistent with flat and gave a transit depth of 400 ± 398 ppm. https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1109.2549H/abstract
