The work presented here was motivated by the TESS-Keck Survey (TKS), a large, dedicated radial velocity program using 
over 100 nights on Keck/HIRES to study exoplanets identified by the NASA TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) 
mission. TKS is a collaboration between researchers at the California Institute of Technology, the University of 
California (Berkeley, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, Santa Cruz), the University of Hawai'i, the University of Kansas, 
NASA, the NASA Exoplanet Science Institute and the W. M. Keck Observatory.
